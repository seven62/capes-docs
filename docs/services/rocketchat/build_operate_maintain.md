### Update Rocketchat
When it's time to update CyberChef, you can just grab the newest image and rerun the container build.
```
sudo docker pull rocketchat/rocket.chat:latest
sudo docker stop capes-rocketchat
sudo docker rm capes-rocketchat
sudo docker run -d --network capes --restart unless-stopped --name capes-rocketchat --link capes-rocketchat-mongo -e "MONGO_URL=mongodb://capes-rocketchat-mongo:27017/rocketchat" -e "ROOT_URL=http://localhost:3000" -p 3000:3000 rocketchat/rocket.chat:latest
```

## Troubleshooting
In the event that you have any issues, here are some things you can check to make sure they're operating as intended.

Is Docker running?
```
sudo systemctl status docker.service
```
Check to make sure it's active, if it isn't, try starting it with `sudo systemctl start docker.service`

Is the Rocketchat and associated MongoDB container running
```
sudo docker ps -a
```
Check to make sure that they are't exited. Try `sudo docker start capes-rocketchat` or `sudo docker logs capes-rocketchat` to get a closer look.

Is the site accessible locally?
```
curl [capes_IP]:3000
or, check from inside the container with
sudo docker exec -it capes-rocketchat bash
curl localhost:3000
```

Check with the Rocketchat project maintainers at https://github.com/RocketChat.

If you're still unable to access the CyberChef page from a web browser, [please file an issue](https://github.com/capesstack/capes-docker/issues).
