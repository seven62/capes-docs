# Portainer
Portainer Community Edition is the foundation of the Portainer world. With over 700 million downloads throughout its history, it’s a powerful, open-source management toolset that allows you to easily build, manage and maintain Docker environments. And it’s completely free. By choosing from a growing range of extensions (available through a simple, low cost in-app subscription) Portainer’s core functionality can be extended to become the ideal toolset to manage docker based environments for organisations of any size.

_Portainer was developed to help customers adopt Docker container technology and accelerate time-to-value._
