# TheHive Build, Operate, Maintain
A scalable, open source and free Security Incident Response Platform, tightly integrated with MISP (Malware Information Sharing Platform), designed to make life easier for SOCs, CSIRTs, CERTs and any information security practitioner dealing with security incidents that need to be investigated and acted upon swiftly.

## Build

### Installation
Run the [CAPES deployment script](../deploy_capes.sh) or deploy manually:

Deploying with CAPES (recommended):
```
sudo yum install -y git
git clone https://github.com/capesstack/capes-docker.git
cd capes-docker
sudo sh deploy_capes.sh
```
Browse to `https://[CAPES-system]` and click the "TheHive" from the "Services" drop down.

Deploying manually:
```
sudo yum install -y docker
sudo groupadd docker
sudo usermod -aG docker "$USER"
sudo systemctl enable docker.service
sudo systemctl start docker.service
sudo docker network create capes
sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/docker/volumes/elasticsearch/thehive/_data
sudo chown -R 1000:1000 /var/lib/docker/volumes/elasticsearch
sudo docker run -d --network capes --restart unless-stopped --name capes-thehive-elasticsearch -v /var/lib/docker/volumes/elasticsearch/thehive/_data:/usr/share/elasticsearch/data:z -e "http.host=0.0.0.0" -e "transport.host=0.0.0.0" -e "xpack.security.enabled=false" -e "cluster.name=hive" -e "script.inline=true" -e "thread_pool.index.queue_size=100000" -e "thread_pool.search.queue_size=100000" -e "thread_pool.bulk.queue_size=100000" docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:5.6.13
sudo docker run -d --network capes --restart unless-stopped --name capes-thehive -e CORTEX_URL=capes-cortex -p 9000:9000 thehiveproject/thehive:latest --es-hostname capes-thehive-elasticsearch --cortex-hostname capes-cortex
```
Browse to `http://[CAPES-system]:9000`

## Operate
1. Browse to TheHive's and Cortex's UI
1. Click "Update Database" and create an administrative account

## Connect Cortex to TheHive
1. Log into Cortex and create a new Organization, create a new organization administrator account in the organization you just created, create a new user called for the API connection (you cannot use the username `api`) with `read,analyze` privileges
1. Click on the Password button next to the organization administrator and create a passphrase and press enter
1. Click on the API button next to the API user you made and copy down the API
1. Open `application.conf` in the root directory of `capes-docker` on your system. Update the API key in the configuration file, everything else should stay the same
1. Run `sudo docker restart capes-thehive`
1. Log into TheHive and in the lower right hand corner, you should see the Cortex logo with a green ring around it meaning you're connected

## Upload Configuration
To get the custom fields with the templates, you'll need to upload the whole configuration file (which is recommended). After this configuration file is uploaded you can make any additional changes that you'd like. The below steps should be performed on your system, not CAPES:

1. Ensure you have [Python3](https://www.python.org/) installed
1. Log into TheHive as an administrator
1. Click on the `Admin` dropdown and select `Users`
1. Either create a new account with `admin` permissions or use an existing account, create and reveal the API key, copy this down
1. Collect the [capes-config.conf](capes-config.conf) file
```
git clone https://github.com/TheHive-Project/TheHive-Resources.git
cd TheHive-Resources/contrib/ManageConfig
sudo pip3 install requests
python3 submit_config.py -k <API key> -u http://CAPES-IP:9000 -c capes-config.conf
```
1. You'll want to refresh your browser and all of the Case Templates and Custom Fields should be in there and ready for use.

## Maintain

### Package Locations
TheHive location - https://blog.thehive-project.org/tag/docker/

### Update TheHive
When it's time to update TheHive, you can just grab the newest image and rerun the container build.
```
sudo docker pull thehiveproject/thehive:latest
sudo docker stop capes-thehive
sudo docker rm capes-thehive
sudo docker run -d --network capes --restart unless-stopped --name capes-thehive -e CORTEX_URL=capes-cortex -p 9000:9000 thehiveproject/thehive:latest --es-hostname capes-thehive-elasticsearch --cortex-hostname capes-cortex
```

## Troubleshooting
In the event that you have any issues, here are some things you can check to make sure they're operating as intended.

Is Docker running?
```
sudo systemctl status docker.service
```
Check to make sure it's active, if it isn't, try starting it with `sudo systemctl start docker.service`

Is the TheHive container running
```
sudo docker ps -a
```
Check to make sure that it isn't exited. Try `sudo docker start capes-thehive` or `sudo docker logs capes-thehive` to get a closer look.

Is the site accessible locally?
```
curl [capes_IP]:9000
or, check from inside the container with
sudo docker exec -it capes-thehive bash
curl localhost:9000
```
