# Mumble
Mumble is a voice over IP (VoIP) application primarily designed for use by gamers and is similar to programs such as TeamSpeak.

Mumble uses a clientâ€“server architecture which allows users to talk to each other via the same server. It has a very simple administrative interface and features high sound quality and low latency. All communication is encrypted to ensure user privacy.

Mumble is free and open-source software, is cross-platform, and is released under the terms of the new BSD license.
