# CyberChef
CyberChef was created, and is maintained, by the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ). GCHQ is one of the UK's security and intelligence agencies, working with its partners in MI5 and SIS. All credit for the service goes to their talented team.

_There are around 150 useful operations in CyberChef for anyone working on anything vaguely Internet-related, whether you just want to convert a timestamp to a different format, decompress gzipped data, create a SHA3 hash, or parse an X.509 certificate to find out who issued it._

_It’s the Cyber Swiss Army Knife._

## What
A simple, intuitive web app for analyzing and decoding data without having to deal with complex tools or programming languages. CyberChef encourages both technical and non-technical people to explore data formats, encryption and compression.

## Why
Digital data comes in all shapes, sizes and formats in the modern world – CyberChef helps to make sense of this data all on one easy-to-use platform.

## How
The interface is designed with simplicity at its heart. Complex techniques are now as trivial as drag-and-drop. Simple functions can be combined to build up a "recipe", potentially resulting in complex analysis, which can be shared with other users and used with their input.

For those comfortable writing code, CyberChef is a quick and efficient way to prototype solutions to a problem which can then be scripted once proven to work.

## Who
It is expected that CyberChef will be useful for cybersecurity and antivirus companies. It should also appeal to the academic world and any individuals or companies involved in the analysis of digital data, be that software developers, analysts, mathematicians or casual puzzle solvers.
